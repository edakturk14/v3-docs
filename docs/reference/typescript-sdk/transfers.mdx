# Tranfers

## Fee Estimation

When sending a cross-chain transfer with Hyperlane GMP, two fees are required:

1. **Local Fee** – gas to submit the transaction on the origin chain
2. **Interchain Fee** – gas to deliver and execute the message on the destination chain

Both are paid upfront to the origin chain.

This fee structure ensures that:

1. The user has enough funds to pay for the local transaction
2. The cross-chain message will have enough gas to execute on the destination chain and pay for the message delivery
3. The total cost of the transfer is transparent to the user before execution

#### Fee Token Considerations

When sending cross-chain transfers, the fee tokens vary by chain type:

1. **EVM Chains**

   - Uses native token (e.g., ETH) for both local and interchain fees

2. **Sealevel (Solana) Chains**

   - Uses native SOL for transaction fees

3. **Cosmos Chains**

   - Supports custom fee tokens
   - Fees are specified using the `denom` parameter

### Estimating Fees

To estimate both fees, use `estimateTransferRemoteFees`:

```ts
const { interchainQuote, localQuote } =
  await warpCore.estimateTransferRemoteFees({
    originToken,
    destination,
    sender,
  });
```

- `interchainQuote`: Fee to route the message to the destination chain (via IGP)
- `localQuote`: Gas cost to send the tx on the origin chain

Each is returned as a TokenAmount which includes:

- `amount`: The quantity of tokens required
- `token`: The token metadata (including chain, decimals, and symbol)

## Using the Fee in Transfers

When making a transfer, you can provide the pre-computed fee quote:

```ts
const txs = await warpCore.getTransferRemoteTxs({
  originTokenAmount,
  destination,
  sender,
  recipient,
});
```

:::warning
Important Considerations:

- Fees may vary between different chain types
- Some chains require additional parameters
- Missing or underpaying fees will cause the transaction to revert
- Fee tokens may differ from the transfer token

## How It Works

Under the hood, the SDK uses [`Mailbox.quoteDispatch()`](/docs/reference/messaging/send#quote-dispatch) to compute the interchain fee. This is the same value that must be passed to `dispatch`.
