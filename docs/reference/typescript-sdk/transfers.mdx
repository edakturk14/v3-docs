# Transfers

## Estimating Fees

To estimate both fees, use `estimateTransferRemoteFees`:

```ts
const { interchainQuote, localQuote } =
  await warpCore.estimateTransferRemoteFees({
    originToken,
    destination,
    sender,
  });
```

- `interchainQuote`: Fee to route the message to the destination chain (via IGP)
- `localQuote`: Gas cost to send the tx on the origin chain

Each is returned as a TokenAmount which includes:

- `amount`: The quantity of tokens required
- `token`: The token metadata (including chain, decimals, and symbol)

## Using the Fee in Transfers

When making a transfer, you can provide the pre-computed fee quote:

```ts
const txs = await warpCore.getTransferRemoteTxs({
  originTokenAmount,
  destination,
  sender,
  recipient,
});
```

:::warning
Important Considerations:

- Fees may vary between different chain types
- Some chains require additional parameters
- Missing or underpaying fees will cause the transaction to revert
- Fee tokens may differ from the transfer token

## How It Works

Under the hood, the SDK uses [`Mailbox.quoteDispatch()`](/docs/reference/messaging/send#quote-dispatch) to compute the interchain fee. This is the same value that must be passed to `dispatch`.
