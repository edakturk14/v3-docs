# Warp Routes

Warp Routes are modular cross-chain asset bridges that enable the transfer of tokens between chains using Hyperlane. Developers can use Hyperlane to permissionlessly deploy Warp Routes to move assets between chains.

They support various asset types, including:

- ERC20 & ERC721 tokens (for EVM-compatible chains)
- SVM-based assets (for SVM-compatible chains)
- Native tokens (such as ETH, or other gas tokens)

You can combine Warp Routes with a Hyperlane deployment to create economic routes between any chain and others already connected through Hyperlane.

### Deploy a Warp Route

Warp Routes can be deployed between any set of chains that have Hyperlane deployments.

To deploy a Warp Route, head over to the following guides:

- [EVM-based Warp Route](/docs/guides/deploy-warp-route)
- [SVM-based Warp Route](/docs/guides/deploy-svm-warp-route)
- [EVM-SVM Warp Route](/docs/guides/deploy-evm-svm-warp-route)

:::tip
If you would like to create a Warp Route that includes a chain that Hyperlane is not currently deployed on, feel free to [deploy Hyperlane](../../deploy-hyperlane.mdx) yourself!

### Modular Security

Like all applications built on top of Hyperlane, Warp Routes have customizable security via [Interchain Security Modules](../../protocol/ISM/modular-security.mdx). This allows Warp Route deployers to configure and enforce custom rules and constraints that the interchain token must follow.

The deployer of a Warp Route can specify the ISMs that are used to verify interchain transfer messages. This means that each Warp Route may have a unique security configuration. Users transferring interchain tokens should understand the trust assumptions of a Route before using it.

:::note
Similarly, Warp frontends should manually curate their warp routes to avoid supporting insecure ones. See the [Warp UI deployment docs](../../guides/deploy-warp-route-UI.mdx) details.

### Warp Route Architecture

Warp Routes transfer value between chains using a lock-and-mint model:

1. Lock tokens on the source chain (the collateral chain)
2. Mint wrapped tokens on the destination chain (the synthetic chain)

Each Warp Route requires a contract deployed on every chain that acts as an entry/exists point. These contracts use the [Mailbox](../mailbox.mdx) to send interchain messages to one another.

The diagram below provides a simplified outline of the process of a Warp Route flow:

Depending on the type of Warp Route, the contract will lock, mint, burn, or release tokens:

1. **Canonical → Non-canonical**: Lock tokens on the origin chain in the `HypERC20Collateral` contract → send message → mint wrapped tokens on the destination.
2. **Non-canonical → Non-canonical**: Burn wrapped tokens → send message → mint wrapped tokens on the new chain.
3. **Non-canonical → Canonical**: Burn wrapped tokens → send message → release original tokens from the `HypERC20Collateral` contract

### Warp Route Types

This table gives a high-level overview of Warp Route types. For detailed explanations, see: [Warp Route Types](warp-routes-types.mdx)

| **Warp Route Type**          | **Description**                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Native Token Warp Routes     | Enables direct transfers of native gas tokens (e.g., ETH) across chains without wrapping.        |
| Collateral-Backed ERC20      | Locks ERC20 tokens as collateral on the source chain for cross-chain transfers.                  |
| Synthetic ERC20              | Mints new ERC20 tokens on the destination chain to represent the original tokens.                |
| Multi-Collateral Warp Routes | Allows liquidity to be sourced from multiple collateral chains.                                  |
| Specialized Warp Routes      | Adds advanced features or integrates with specific use cases (e.g., vaults, fiat-backed tokens.) |
