# Warp Routes

Warp Routes are modular cross-chain asset bridges that enable the transfer of tokens between chains using Hyperlane. Developers can use Hyperlane to permissionlessly deploy Warp Routes to move assets between chains.

They support various asset types, including:

- ERC20 & ERC721 tokens (for EVM-compatible chains)
- SVM-based assets (for SVM-compatible chains)
- Native tokens (such as ETH, or other gas tokens)

You can combine Warp Routes with a Hyperlane deployment to create economic routes between any chain and others already connected through Hyperlane.

## Deploy a Warp Route

Warp Routes can be deployed between any set of chains that have Hyperlane deployments.

To deploy a Warp Route, head over to the following guides:

- [EVM-based Warp Route](/docs/guides/deploy-warp-route)
- [SVM-based Warp Route](/docs/guides/deploy-svm-warp-route)
- [EVM-SVM Warp Route](/docs/guides/deploy-evm-svm-warp-route)

:::tip
If you would like to create a Warp Route that includes a chain that Hyperlane is not currently deployed on, feel free to [deploy Hyperlane](../../deploy-hyperlane.mdx) yourself!

## Modular Security

Like all applications built on top of Hyperlane, Warp Routes have customizable security via [Interchain Security Modules](../../protocol/ISM/modular-security.mdx).

The deployer of a Warp Route can specify the ISMs that are used to verify interchain transfer messages. This means that each Warp Route may have a unique security configuration. Users transferring interchain tokens should understand the trust assumptions of a Route before using it.

:::note
Similarly, Warp frontends should manually curate their warp routes to avoid supporting insecure ones. See the [Warp UI deployment docs](../../guides/deploy-warp-route-UI.mdx) details.

## Warp Route Architecture

Warp Routes let deployers choose how tokens are transferred between chains. Depending on the type of Warp Route, contracts will lock tokens, mint wrapped tokens, burn wrapped tokens, or release original tokens.

For example:

1. **Collateral → Synthetic**: Tokens are locked on the origin (collateral) chain, a message is sent, and wrapped tokens are minted on the destination (synthetic) chain.
2. **Synthetic → Synthetic**: Tokens are burned on the origin chain, a message is sent, and new wrapped tokens are minted on the destination chain.
3. **Synthetic → Collateral**: Tokens are burned on the origin chain, a message is sent, and the original tokens are released from the collateral contract on the destination chain.

Each Warp Route requires a contract deployed on every chain that acts as an entry/exists point. These contracts use the [Mailbox](../mailbox.mdx) to send interchain messages to one another.

### Warp Route Types

This table gives a high-level overview of Warp Route types. For detailed explanations, see: [Warp Route Types.](warp-routes-types.mdx)

| **Warp Route Type**          | **Description**                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Native Token Warp Routes     | Enables direct transfers of native gas tokens (e.g., ETH) across chains without wrapping.        |
| Collateral-Backed ERC20      | Locks ERC20 tokens as collateral on the source chain for cross-chain transfers.                  |
| Synthetic ERC20              | Mints new ERC20 tokens on the destination chain to represent the original tokens.                |
| Multi-Collateral Warp Routes | Allows liquidity to be sourced from multiple collateral chains.                                  |
| Specialized Warp Routes      | Adds advanced features or integrates with specific use cases (e.g., vaults, fiat-backed tokens.) |

### Example Architecture

Let’s walk through a **Collateral** to **Synthetic** Warp Route using the lock-and-mint model to transfer ERC20 tokens between two chains:

1. The user locks their tokens on the collateral chain (e.g., Ethereum) in the `HypERC20Collateral` contract.
2. A message is sent through Hyperlane’s Mailbox and relayed to the synthetic chain (e.g., Base).
3. On the destination chain, the `HypERC20` contract mints wrapped tokens to the user.

In the diagram below, the ISM is a [Multisig ISM](/docs/protocol/ISM/multisig-ISM), which uses a set of validators to approve messages. (Note: Not all ISMs require validators, this depends on the chosen security model.)

Here’s a simplified view of the flow:
